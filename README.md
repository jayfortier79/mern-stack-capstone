Technologies Used: APIs from the API ninjas collection (https://api-ninjas.com/); Vite; Mongodb/Mongoose; Axios; React.


Getting Started: Links to the project's planning (Trello board) and the deployed app.


Unsolved Problems: Currently functioning correctly. 


Future Enhancements: Would like to include a fitness diary section especially, which could imnpliment full crud functionality and make the need to log in and out apperant. I could also continue to bring in more APIs so that more fitness related data could be available to users. Finally, I would like to improve the presentation and styling.
